# Portfolio-Project-Register
This project was made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (front-end and Node.js for back-end) with a little bit of jQuery. This was a personal project for my portfolio to demonstrate a register page with real-time validation and dynamic JavaScript text injection depending on if the user accepted the Terms and Privacy. I completed this project in September of 2019. Additional features include the ability to show/hide the password input field and when the register button is clicked with valid information (also with the Terms and Privacy checked), the password gets bcrypted. Show the password once registration is successful.
